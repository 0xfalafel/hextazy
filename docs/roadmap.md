# Roadmap

The objective is to implement the following __features__ for the __1.0 release__.
The features are listed in no particular order:

[ ] __Insert mode__, to not only _overwrite_ bytes but also have the possibility to insert new ones.
[ ] Improve the UI by adding a bar at the bottom indicating the offset of the cursor, the edition mode, if changes were made to the file, etc.
[ ] __Github actions__ to create arm binaries, and `.deb` packages.
[ ] Improve the readability of the cusor, by doing something similar to the cursors in _neovim_.

Some other features that I want to implement, but might be after `1.0`.

[ ] Color files to __customize__ how the __bytes are colorized__.
[ ] Maybe color in a smart way common file formats.
[ ] Make search async, so that the ui don't freeze when searching on large file (10Gb and more). Might be done after 1.0. 
[ ] Selection bytes to view the value of bytes as signed and unsigned integers, octal, etc.
[ ] Create unit tests seriously.
